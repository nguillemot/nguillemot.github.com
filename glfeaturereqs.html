  <title>GL Feature Requirements</title>

<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>With GL it's possible to write one code base that targets a very wide range of platforms,
which is done by dynamically querying the hardware's capabilities.
However, it's hard to know what are all the different ways to access a feature and what needs to be checked before using a feature.
This web page attempts to keep track of all these kinds of decisions to make it easy to write highly compatible code.</p>

<p>From a high level perspective, each GL featurehas different requirements to be available based on:
<ol>
  <li>The API in use (eg: OpenGL, OpenGL ES, WebGL)</li>
  <li>The version of the API in use (eg: GL 4.3, GL ES 3.0, WebGL 2.0)</li>
  <li>The extensions available (eg: GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two, GL_KHR_debug)</li>
</ol>
Furthermore, there exists quirks and bugs in GL implementations that will be documented here as they become known.</p>
