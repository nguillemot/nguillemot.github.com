  <title>GL Feature Requirements</title>

<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>With GL it's possible to write one code base that targets a very wide range of platforms,
which is done by dynamically querying the hardware's capabilities.
However, it's hard to know what are all the different ways to access a feature and what needs to be checked before using a feature.
This web page attempts to keep track of all these kinds of decisions to make it easy to write highly compatible code.</p>

<p>From a high level perspective, each GL featurehas different requirements to be available based on:
<ol>
  <li>The API in use (eg: OpenGL, OpenGL ES, WebGL)</li>
  <li>The version of the API in use (eg: GL 4.3, GL ES 3.0, WebGL 2.0)</li>
  <li>The extensions available (eg: GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two, GL_KHR_debug)</li>
</ol>
Furthermore, there exists quirks and bugs in GL implementations that will be documented here as they become known.</p>

<hi>Determining the API in use and its version</hi>

<p>This is done using the output of <i>glGetString(GL_VERSION)</i>:<\br>
<ul>
  <li>In OpenGL, this function returns <i>major_number.minor_number</i> or <i>major_number.minor_number.release_number</i>, optionally followed by a space and vendor-specific information.</li>
  <li>In OpenGL ES, this function returns <i>OpenGL ES major_number.minor_number</i> or <i>major_number.minor_number.release_number</i> optionally followed by a space and vendor-specific information.</li>
  <li>In WebGL, this function returns <i>WebGL major_number.minor_number</i> optionally followed by a space and vendor-specific information</i>.</li>
</ul>

Thus, it is necessary to check if the string begins with "WebGL" or "OpenGL ES" or neither in order to determine what API is currently in use.
The version of the API in use can then be determined by parsing the major_number.minor_number from the string.
